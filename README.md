Learning how to create/deploy a functional website from scratch! Based on Colt Steele's Udemy course

The site still lacks some main functionalities, but I finally have implemented Passport.js to introduce post/comment ownership. 

I hope to implement the following features
-ability to upload more images! (gallery)
-campgrounds' location with Google map API
-weather forecast
-rating system
